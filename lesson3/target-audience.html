    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>The audience for this website is primarily farmers.

    weather forecast to make decisions in their daily activities.  
    These farmers mostly live in small communities in this somewhat remote area of Idaho.
  They will also come to this website to find out about events and 
  activities of the region in which they may have interest.</p>

      He has a small family that wants to participate in community events that will 
    allow them to make friends.</p>
    <p>Joan Barton is a 68-year-old Potato Farmer.  Her older children help her run the farm.
